## Overview  

The **Hostel Management System** is a web-based application developed using **Django** to streamline the management of hostel facilities. This platform allows students to **register, book rooms, and manage their hostel details**, while administrators can oversee room availability and student records.  

## Key Features  

- **Student Login System** – Secure authentication for students to access their dashboard.  
- **Dashboard Analytics** – Displays the number of registered students, available rooms, and booked rooms.  
- **Hostel Booking** – Students can search for and book available hostel rooms.  
- **Room Details Management** – Users can view their assigned rooms and update details.  
- **Activity Logs** – Tracks student activities and room changes for better management.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Backend:** Django (Python)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap for styling)  
- **Database:** SQLite / PostgreSQL  
- **Authentication:** Django’s built-in authentication system  
- **Hosting:** Deployed using AWS / DigitalOcean / Heroku (if applicable)  

## Challenges and Learnings  

One major challenge was **handling real-time room availability** and preventing double booking. This was solved by implementing a **transaction-based booking system** with **database locks** to ensure data consistency. Additionally, optimizing **database queries** improved the system’s performance.  

## Outcome  

The **Hostel Management System** has made it easier for students to book and manage their hostel accommodations efficiently. The admin panel helps hostel managers **monitor occupancy, track student activities, and manage room assignments seamlessly**.
